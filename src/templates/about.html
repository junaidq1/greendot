 		greendotpeers.com is a portal where consulting practitioners at Deloitte Consulting can search for and provide feedback on their colleagues (Managers, Senior Managers and PPDs) anonymously. </p>

 		Management Consulting firms operate under a unique talent model. Junior practitioners are recruited into a talent pool with no direct managerial reporting heirarchy. The expectation from the firm is that they will own their own career and be responsible for utilization metrics. The way to do that is by getting to know senior practitioners and having them staff you on the enagegements they sell. 
 		</p>
 		<p class='lead text-align-center'>
 		Yet, for a business model that is built on leveraging data for adding value, there is surprisingly little data available to junior practitioners on the prospective senior folks they can choose to work with.
